                How Does Social Anxiety Affect the Brain?
              </h2>

                Areas of brain affected | Body during social anxiety | Causes |
                Next steps
              </p>
              <p class="hidden">
                Research shows changes in important areas of the brain, such as
                the hippocampus and amygdala, can be affected by social anxiety.
                <br /><br />Social anxiety disorder, also known as social
                phobia, is a form of anxiety that causes intense fear and
                embarrassment in social situations. <br /><br />For example,
                it’s common to feel slightly nervous when meeting new people or
                speaking in public. People with social anxiety disorder can
                experience a paralyzing fear that makes it hard for them to live
                everyday life. <br /><br />We now know that social anxiety
                disorder affects more than just relationships, work, and other
                daily activities — it also affects the brain.
                <br /><br />Researchers have found that critical areas in the
                brains of socially anxious people function differently. These
                areas mainly involve processing emotion, danger, and social
                cues. <br /><br /><br />
                Areas of the brain affected by social anxiety:
                <br /><br />Amygdala: <br />The amygdala is the part of the
                brain that deals with emotions, especially fear, anxiety, and
                aggression. It controls the “fight, flight, freeze, or fawn”
                response when faced with a threat. It’s not surprising then that
                the amygdala plays a central role in social anxiety.The most
                crucial difference is that the amygdala is often overactive in
                response to social interactions. For example, when socially
                anxious people are shown fearful faces, their amygdala lights
                upTrusted Source — a sign of a heightened fear response.
                <br /><br />Prefrontal cortex: <br />The prefrontal cortex (PFC)
                is involved in many aspects of our behavior, including planning,
                decision-making, and self-control.In contrast to the amygdala,
                the PFC is generally underactiveTrusted Source and
                smallerTrusted Source in those with social anxiety. There are
                also significant differences in how the PFC communicates with
                other brain areas. Typically, the PFC sends signals to the
                amygdala to keep it from becoming too active during routine
                social interactions. <br /><br />Anterior cingulate cortex:
                <br />The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a vital role in
                regulating emotions. It’s especially involved in processing
                social rejection and coping with stress due to social
                interactions.The ACC becomes overactive in socially anxious
                peopleTrusted Source when they look at faces with negative
                facial expressions. This supports 2019 research showing that
                people with taijin-kyofusho, a subtype of social anxiety, are
                overly sensitive to how others perceive them.
                <br /><br />Fusiform gyrus: <br />The fusiform gyrus is a part
                of the brain that is involved in processing faces and
                determining the emotional state of others. As such, it plays a
                crucial role in social interactions.2021 researchTrusted Source
                found fusiform gyrus can be either overactive or underactive in
                people with social anxiety disorder, depending on the coping
                strategies that person has developed.If a person with social
                anxiety has made it a habit to avoid looking at faces, then the
                fusiform gyrus will be less active. <br /><br />Hippocampus:
                <br />The hippocampus is actively involved in learning and
                memory. Research suggests it may also play an essential role in
                social anxiety.According to 2016 researchTrusted Source, when
                socially anxious people see faces of people they haven’t seen
                before, their hippocampus goes into overdrive. When they are
                repeatedly shown these faces, they never learn to become
                familiar as a person without anxiety does. Instead, they
                continue to identify the faces as threatening. This explains why
                people with social anxiety have a much harder time meeting new
                people.
