            <br>
            1] Find a comfortable seat: Sit comfortably on a cushion or chair, ensuring stability and relaxation.
            <br><br>
            2]Check your leg and foot position: Be aware of how your legs and feet are positioned for comfort and stability.
            <br><br>
            3]Straighten your upper body: Maintain a relaxed yet upright posture, allowing your spine to find its natural curve.
            <br><br>
            4]Adjust your arms: Position them parallel to your body, resting your hands comfortably on your legs or in your lap.
            <br><br>
            5]Soften your gaze: Relax your facial muscles and lower your gaze gently, allowing it to rest without strain.
            <br><br>
            6]Focus on your breath: Direct your attention to the sensation of breathing, using it as an anchor to stay present.

          <h2>Benefits -</h2>
          
          <p class="pbeni"><br>
            Of course, when we meditate it doesn’t help to fixate on the benefits, but rather just to do the practice. That being said, there are plenty of benefits. Here are five reasons to practice mindfulness.
            <br><br>
            &#8226; Understand your pain. Pain is a fact of life, but it doesn’t have to rule you. Mindfulness can help you reshape your relationship with mental and physical pain. <br><br>
            &#8226; Connect better. Ever find yourself staring blankly at a friend, lover, child, and you’ve no idea what they’re saying? Mindfulness helps you give them your full attention. <br><br>
            &#8226; Lower stress. There’s lots of evidence these days that excess stress causes lots of illnesses and makes other illnesses worse. Mindfulness decreases stress. <br><br>
            &#8226; Focus your mind. It can be frustrating to have our mind stray off what we’re doing and be pulled in six directions. Meditation hones our innate ability to focus. <br><br>
            &#8226; Reduce brain chatter.The nattering, chattering voice in our head seems never to leave us alone. Isn’t it time we gave it a little break?

            <p>
              Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, or OCD, is a mental health condition that affects people of all ages and backgrounds. It is a type of anxiety disorder that causes persistent, unwanted thoughts or compulsions that interfere with daily life. OCD can manifest in many ways, but some common symptoms can help identify it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
              Symptoms of OCD</h2>
              <br>
              <p>OCD symptoms can include intrusive and persistent thoughts, images, or urges, often related to specific fears or worries. For example, someone with OCD may fear germs and feel compelled to wash their hands repeatedly or avoid touching particular objects. They may also need symmetry or order, which can result in repetitive behaviours such as arranging and rearranging items in a specific way.</p>
              <p>Other common symptoms of OCD can include:</p>
              <p>Hoarding</p>
              <p>Excessive checking (such as repeatedly checking that doors are locked or appliances are turned off).</p>
              <p>Mental rituals such as counting or repeating specific phrases to prevent harm.</p>
              <p>These behaviours can be distressing and time-consuming and significantly impact a person's quality of life.

                It's important to note that everyone experiences intrusive thoughts or behaviours from time to time, and having these thoughts does not necessarily mean someone has OCD. However, if these thoughts or behaviours become persistent and interfere with daily life, it may indicate OCD.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h2>When to seek support for OCD</h2>
              <br>
              <p>If you're concerned that you or a loved one may be experiencing symptoms of OCD, it's important to seek support from a qualified healthcare professional. This may include a GP or mental health specialist, who can assess symptoms, provide a diagnosis, and recommend appropriate treatment options.

                Several evidence-based treatments are available for OCD, including cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and medication. CBT involves working with a therapist to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts and behaviours, while medication can help reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression that may be associated with OCD.
              </p>
              <p>
                Early intervention can lead to better outcomes. If you suspect that you or a loved one may be experiencing symptoms of OCD, seek support as soon as possible. In addition, support from loved ones can be beneficial for those with OCD, as it can provide emotional support and encouragement during treatment.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are concerned about a loved one who may be experiencing symptoms of OCD, there are several things you can do to offer support. One of the most important things is to listen without judgement and provide a safe and supportive space for them to talk about their experiences. You can also encourage them to seek professional support and offer to help them find a qualified healthcare professional or attend appointments with them.
              </p>
              <p>
                OCD is treatable, and seeking support is a brave and vital step towards recovery. With the right support and treatment, many people with OCD can manage their symptoms and live fulfilling lives.

        <h1>Understanding conduct disorders in children and teenagers</h1>

        <div class="para">
          <p>
            As a parent, it can be hard to determine when your child's behaviour is just a phase or if there's an underlying issue that needs to be addressed. If you are worried about a child or teenager exhibiting patterns of behaviour that go against social norms and are not in line with their age, it's important to seek help.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>What is a conduct disorder?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>A conduct disorder is a persistent behaviour pattern involving breaking social norms and laws. For example, children and teenagers with a conduct disorder may engage in activities such as hurting others, lying, or stealing and may find satisfaction in these actions</p>
            <p>OConduct disorders can be difficult to diagnose, as some of these behaviours may result from environmental factors or other mental health conditions.
            </p>
            <h2>Common symptoms of conduct disorders</h2>
            <br>
            <p>It's important to note that not all children and teenagers with conduct disorders display these symptoms, and some may exhibit behaviours not listed here.</p>
            <p>
             
              Bullying, threatening and intimidating others
              Physical fights
              Running away from home or staying out past curfew
              Using weapons or dangerous objects
              Physical cruelty to others or animals
              Breaking into properties or vehicles
              Forcing others into sexual acts
              Damaging others' property
              Arson or setting fires
              Lying to manipulate
              Skipping schoo
              Stealing from others
            </p>
            <h2>Seeking help for a conduct disorder</h2>
            <p>Early intervention is key to preventing conduct disorder behaviours from escalating. Some parents may hesitate to seek help due to embarrassment or shame, but it's important to remember that behavioural problems are common and that treatment can make a significant impact.</p>
            <p>The benefits of seeking help for a conduct disorder include:
            </p>
            <h3>Improved family life</h3>
            <p>Having a child with a conduct disorder can be highly stressful for the entire family. With the right help, your teenager's behaviour can improve, and arguments between family members can become less frequent.</p>
            
            <h3>Better future outcomes
            </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Children and teenagers with conduct disorders are at a higher risk of developing antisocial personality disorder as adults. Seeking help early can help prevent this outcome.
            </p>
            <h3>Safer behaviours   </h3>
         
            <p>
              Many children and teens with conduct disorders engage in dangerous activities. Seeking help early can reduce the likelihood of these behaviours
            </p>
            <h3>Improved mental health
            </h3>
            <p>
              Other mental health conditions, such as ADHD, depression, autism, and anxiety, often accompany conduct disorders. A comprehensive assessment by a professional can help determine the cause of the behaviour and provide the right help for your child and family.
            </p>
            <h2>Experienced support is available
            </h2>
            <p>
              A child and adolescent psychiatrist is the best person to assess your child and determine if they have a conduct disorder or another mental health condition. After an assessment, we can formulate an effective treatment plan that can significantly improve the situation for both your child and family.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Medication can sometimes be effective for accompanying conditions, such as ADHD. For example, stimulant medication can improve a child's ability to concentrate and reduce frustration, while atypical antipsychotics can reduce aggression and enhance a child's ability to participate in behavioural therapy.</p>
            <p>The best place to start is with a confidential call with an experienced team member.

          As a parent, it's natural to feel concerned when your child or teenager displays angry, aggressive, or violent behaviour. However, it's important to know that help is available to support you and your family through this difficult time.

        <h2>
          The causes of anger, aggression, and tantrums in young children
        </h2>
          <br>
          <p>For young children, anger and aggression can stem from various sources, such as difficulties in school, at home, or with friends. Social pressures, bullying, and conflicts at home can be incredibly stressful for children, leading to outbursts of anger.</p>
          <p>Other common symptoms of OCD can include:</p>
          <p>In some cases, aggressive behaviour can also signify underlying conditions such as ADHD, depression, anxiety, or another emotional or mental health issue.</p>
          <p>Young children may find it challenging to express their emotions, and anger or aggression becomes a way for them to communicate their feelings. Children need to learn how to self-regulate their emotions and manage their anger, which takes time and patience</p>
          <h2>The causes of anger, aggression, and violence in teenagers
          </h2>
          <p>During adolescence, the brain undergoes significant changes, which play a vital role in decision-making, social behaviour, and personality expression. This rewiring process can result in impulsive behaviour, angry outbursts, and difficulty in empathy.
          </p>
          
          <!-- <h2>When to seek support for OCD</h2> -->
          
          <p>The teenage years are also a crucial stage of identity development, and teens may push boundaries and challenge rules as they establish their sense of self.

            Stressful situations at school, at home, or with friends can also lead to angry or aggressive behaviour. For example, teens who feel bullied or stressed may lash out at those closest to them, such as their parents. In addition, they may not know how to express their feelings in a more measured way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conditions such as ADHD, autism, depression, or anxiety can also contribute to violent or aggressive behaviour in teenagers. Worryingly, it's estimated that only 30% of children with diagnosable mental health conditions receive the help they need.


          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>Treatment for anger, aggression, and violence
          </h2>
          <p>
            Our team of behaviour specialists has helped thousands of families address and manage these issues through face-to-face appointments or online support.
          </p>
          <p>
            Talking therapies such as CBT can help your child manage and work through problematic behaviours. Based on your child's circumstances, a psychiatric assessment may be necessary to identify any underlying issues. An evaluation by a child and adolescent mental health expert can provide an effective treatment plan for anxiety, depression, self-harm, or ADHD.

                How Does Social Anxiety Affect the Brain?
              </h2>
              <p class="blog-description">
                Areas of brain affected | Body during social anxiety | Causes |
                Next steps
              </p>
              <p class="hidden">
                Research shows changes in important areas of the brain, such as
                the hippocampus and amygdala, can be affected by social anxiety.
                <br /><br />Social anxiety disorder, also known as social
                phobia, is a form of anxiety that causes intense fear and
                embarrassment in social situations. <br /><br />For example,
                it’s common to feel slightly nervous when meeting new people or
                speaking in public. People with social anxiety disorder can
                experience a paralyzing fear that makes it hard for them to live
                everyday life. <br /><br />We now know that social anxiety
                disorder affects more than just relationships, work, and other
                daily activities — it also affects the brain.
                <br /><br />Researchers have found that critical areas in the
                brains of socially anxious people function differently. These
                areas mainly involve processing emotion, danger, and social
                cues. <br /><br /><br />
                Areas of the brain affected by social anxiety:
                <br /><br />Amygdala: <br />The amygdala is the part of the
                brain that deals with emotions, especially fear, anxiety, and
                aggression. It controls the “fight, flight, freeze, or fawn”
                response when faced with a threat. It’s not surprising then that
                the amygdala plays a central role in social anxiety.The most
                crucial difference is that the amygdala is often overactive in
                response to social interactions. For example, when socially
                anxious people are shown fearful faces, their amygdala lights
                upTrusted Source — a sign of a heightened fear response.
                <br /><br />Prefrontal cortex: <br />The prefrontal cortex (PFC)
                is involved in many aspects of our behavior, including planning,
                decision-making, and self-control.In contrast to the amygdala,
                the PFC is generally underactiveTrusted Source and
                smallerTrusted Source in those with social anxiety. There are
                also significant differences in how the PFC communicates with
                other brain areas. Typically, the PFC sends signals to the
                amygdala to keep it from becoming too active during routine
                social interactions. <br /><br />Anterior cingulate cortex:
                <br />The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a vital role in
                regulating emotions. It’s especially involved in processing
                social rejection and coping with stress due to social
                interactions.The ACC becomes overactive in socially anxious
                peopleTrusted Source when they look at faces with negative
                facial expressions. This supports 2019 research showing that
                people with taijin-kyofusho, a subtype of social anxiety, are
                overly sensitive to how others perceive them.
                <br /><br />Fusiform gyrus: <br />The fusiform gyrus is a part
                of the brain that is involved in processing faces and
                determining the emotional state of others. As such, it plays a
                crucial role in social interactions.2021 researchTrusted Source
                found fusiform gyrus can be either overactive or underactive in
                people with social anxiety disorder, depending on the coping
                strategies that person has developed.If a person with social
                anxiety has made it a habit to avoid looking at faces, then the
                fusiform gyrus will be less active. <br /><br />Hippocampus:
                <br />The hippocampus is actively involved in learning and
                memory. Research suggests it may also play an essential role in
                social anxiety.According to 2016 researchTrusted Source, when
                socially anxious people see faces of people they haven’t seen
                before, their hippocampus goes into overdrive. When they are
                repeatedly shown these faces, they never learn to become
                familiar as a person without anxiety does. Instead, they
                continue to identify the faces as threatening. This explains why
                people with social anxiety have a much harder time meeting new
                people.

    <h1>Exercise and the Brain: The Mental Health Benefits of Exercise</h1>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Exercise can help to regulate stress hormones and trigger the release of mood-bosting neurotransmitters. When combined with other treatments, exercise can help with symptoms of several mental health conditions, including depression and ADHD.</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="exer-img">
    <img src="exercise1.jpg" width="800" alt="">
    <div class="contentex">
      <p>It’s well known that regular exercise has numerous positive health outcomes for the body, such as strengthening the muscles, bones, heart, and lungs and helping to prevent certain diseases.</p>
      <br>
        <p>One often-overlooked benefit is the impact of physical activity on mental health.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Considering the high prevalence of anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions worldwide, countless people may benefit from the positive mental health effects of exercise.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In this article we’ll address the relationship among exercise, various mental health conditions, and the brain, as well as how diet may impact your mental health.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="exer-impact">

    <div class="impact1"><h1>How does exercise impact the brain?</h1>
      <br>
      <p>While exercising may seem fairly simple on the surface, a complex chemical cascade occurs inside your body each time you go for a run, hit the gym, or participate in any other physical activity.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        This chemical cascade is responsible for several positive effects on your brain
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    
    <div class="brain">
      <img src="brain.jpeg.jpg" width="500" alt="">
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <div class="impact2"><h1>Releases neurotransmitters</h1>
      <br>
      <p>☑
        As you begin exercising, depending on the intensity, a number of important chemical messengers called neurotransmitters are released throughout your nervous system.</p>
      <br>
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <div class="impact3"><h1>Endorphins and endocannabinoids</h1>
      <br>
      
      <p>☑
        Perhaps the most common neurotransmitters people think of in relation to exercise are endorphins. But lesser known neurotransmitters called endocannabinoids also play an important role in your brain when you’re working out.
      </p>
      <br>
       <p>☑
        Endorphins block pain and increase sensations of pleasure, and exercise certainly increases your endorphin levels
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>☑
        But recent research suggests that the euphoric feeling you get after a hard workout may result from endorphins and endocannabinoids working in tandem.
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>☑
        Endocannabinoids, in particular, are a group of neurotransmitters that are thought to be responsible for that “runner’s high” — the feeling of calm euphoria that occurs after a strenuous workout
       </p>
      </div>
      <br><br>

        <div class="impact4"> <h1>Dopamine</h1>
          <br>
          <p>☑
           Another impactful exercise-related neurotransmitter is dopamine.</p>
          <br>
          <p>☑
           Dopamine plays an important role in how you feel pleasure. It’s also responsible for other processes in your body, such as regulating heart rate, sleep cycles, mood, attention, motivation, working memory, learning, and pain processing 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>☑
           Data is limited on which type of exercise best stimulates dopamine release, so more research is necessary.</p>
        </div>
        <br><br>
    
     <div class="impact5"><h1>Promotes neuroplasticity</h1>
      <br>
      <p>☑
       Neuroplasticity is the ability of your brain and nervous system to change their activity in response to internal or external stimuli</p>
      <br>
      <p>☑
       This plays a huge role in learning new skills, activities, and languages.</p>
      <br>
      <p>☑
       Some research suggests that exercise can promote neuroplasticity by increasing certain signaling factors </p>
      <br>
    </div>
    <br><br>
     

     <div class="impact6">
      <h1>Increases oxygen supply to the brain</h1>
      <br>
      <p>☑
       As your heart starts to pump faster during exercise, it increases the oxygen supply to your brain.</p>
      <br>
      <p>☑
       This results in certain changes to the blood vessels of your brain, promoting potential improvements in executive function, which includes working memory, flexible thinking, and self-control</p>
      <br>
      <p>☑
       In a 2021 study in 48 adults with mild cognitive impairment, researchers looked at the impact of exercise on blood flow to the cerebrum. This is the largest part of the brain and is responsible for higher intellectual function, sensory impulses, and motor activity</p>
      <br>
      <p>☑
       They found that a 1-year moderate to vigorous exercise program increased cerebral blood flow and reduced the risk of further cognitive decline.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>☑
       This suggests that regular physical activity can improve blood flow to important parts of your brain, in turn reducing your risk of conditions related to cognitive decline, such as Alzheimer’s disease and stroke</p>
      </div>
