          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <p>
            1] Sit comfortably. Find a spot that gives you a stable, solid, comfortable seat.
            <br><br>
            2] Notice what your legs are doing. If on a cushion, cross your legs comfortably in front of you. If on a chair, rest the bottoms of your feet on the floor.
            <br><br>
            3] Straighten your upper body—but don’t stiffen. Your spine has natural curvature. Let it be there.
            <br><br>
            4] Notice what your arms are doing. Situate your upper arms parallel to your upper body. Rest the palms of your hands on your legs wherever it feels most natural.
            <br><br>
            5] Soften your gaze. Drop your chin a little and let your gaze fall gently downward. It’s not necessary to close your eyes. You can simply let what appears before your eyes be there without focusing on it.
            <br><br>
            6] Feel your breath. Bring your attention to the physical sensation of breathing: the air moving through your nose or mouth, the rising and falling of your belly, or your chest.
            <br><br>
            7] Notice when your mind wanders from your breath. Inevitably, your attention will leave the breath and wander to other places. Don’t worry. There’s no need to block or eliminate thinking. When you notice your mind wandering gently return your attention to the breath.
            <br><br>
            8] Be kind about your wandering mind. You may find your mind wandering constantly—that’s normal, too. Instead of wrestling with your thoughts, practice observing them without reacting. Just sit and pay attention. As hard as it is to maintain, that’s all there is. Come back to your breath over and over again, without judgment or expectation.
            <br><br>
            9] When you’re ready, gently lift your gaze (if your eyes are closed, open them). Take a moment and notice any sounds in the environment. Notice how your body feels right now. Notice your thoughts and emotions.</p>
          <br><br><br>
          <h2>What are the benefits of meditation?</h2>
          <p><br>
            Of course, when we meditate it doesn’t help to fixate on the benefits, but rather just to do the practice. That being said, there are plenty of benefits. Here are five reasons to practice mindfulness.
            <br><br>
            &#8226; Understand your pain. Pain is a fact of life, but it doesn’t have to rule you. Mindfulness can help you reshape your relationship with mental and physical pain. <br>
            &#8226; Connect better. Ever find yourself staring blankly at a friend, lover, child, and you’ve no idea what they’re saying? Mindfulness helps you give them your full attention. <br>
            &#8226; Lower stress. There’s lots of evidence these days that excess stress causes lots of illnesses and makes other illnesses worse. Mindfulness decreases stress. <br>
            &#8226; Focus your mind. It can be frustrating to have our mind stray off what we’re doing and be pulled in six directions. Meditation hones our innate ability to focus. <br>
            &#8226; Reduce brain chatter.The nattering, chattering voice in our head seems never to leave us alone. Isn’t it time we gave it a little break?

                Do you feel that you are able to change ingrained patterns of
                behavior that you have had for a long time? If not, you’re not
                alone! Most people feel that behaviors (as well as thoughts) are
                difficult to change. And they are right. Behavior modification
                requires dedication, strength, and courage. In this short
                article (video), I discuss the A-B-C Model of behavior
                management. Changing your behavior requires an understanding of
                what is triggering you, causing your beliefs and behaviors, and
                leading to negative or positive consequences. Without this
                understanding it will be hard to change what is causing the
                problem. For example, if you are having marital problems because
                of always working and never being home for dinner, for
                conversation, or for family time but cannot identify the source
                of the problem (i.e, working too much), your beliefs around it
                (“I have to work”), and the consequences (i.e., getting into an
                argument with your husband). The A-B-C- Model is a form of
                cognitive behavior therapy which focused on the connection
                between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. The A-B-C- Model

                How Does Social Anxiety Affect the Brain?
              </h2>
              <p class="blog-description">
                Areas of brain affected | Body during social anxiety | Causes |
                Next steps
              </p>
              <p class="hidden">
                Research shows changes in important areas of the brain, such as
                the hippocampus and amygdala, can be affected by social anxiety.
                <br /><br />Social anxiety disorder, also known as social
                phobia, is a form of anxiety that causes intense fear and
                embarrassment in social situations. <br /><br />For example,
                it’s common to feel slightly nervous when meeting new people or
                speaking in public. People with social anxiety disorder can
                experience a paralyzing fear that makes it hard for them to live
                everyday life. <br /><br />We now know that social anxiety
                disorder affects more than just relationships, work, and other
                daily activities — it also affects the brain.
                <br /><br />Researchers have found that critical areas in the
                brains of socially anxious people function differently. These
                areas mainly involve processing emotion, danger, and social
                cues. <br /><br /><br />
                Areas of the brain affected by social anxiety:
                <br /><br />Amygdala: <br />The amygdala is the part of the
                brain that deals with emotions, especially fear, anxiety, and
                aggression. It controls the “fight, flight, freeze, or fawn”
                response when faced with a threat. It’s not surprising then that
                the amygdala plays a central role in social anxiety.The most
                crucial difference is that the amygdala is often overactive in
                response to social interactions. For example, when socially
                anxious people are shown fearful faces, their amygdala lights
                upTrusted Source — a sign of a heightened fear response.
                <br /><br />Prefrontal cortex: <br />The prefrontal cortex (PFC)
                is involved in many aspects of our behavior, including planning,
                decision-making, and self-control.In contrast to the amygdala,
                the PFC is generally underactiveTrusted Source and
                smallerTrusted Source in those with social anxiety. There are
                also significant differences in how the PFC communicates with
                other brain areas. Typically, the PFC sends signals to the
                amygdala to keep it from becoming too active during routine
                social interactions. <br /><br />Anterior cingulate cortex:
                <br />The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a vital role in
                regulating emotions. It’s especially involved in processing
                social rejection and coping with stress due to social
                interactions.The ACC becomes overactive in socially anxious
                peopleTrusted Source when they look at faces with negative
                facial expressions. This supports 2019 research showing that
                people with taijin-kyofusho, a subtype of social anxiety, are
                overly sensitive to how others perceive them.
                <br /><br />Fusiform gyrus: <br />The fusiform gyrus is a part
                of the brain that is involved in processing faces and
                determining the emotional state of others. As such, it plays a
                crucial role in social interactions.2021 researchTrusted Source
                found fusiform gyrus can be either overactive or underactive in
                people with social anxiety disorder, depending on the coping
                strategies that person has developed.If a person with social
                anxiety has made it a habit to avoid looking at faces, then the
                fusiform gyrus will be less active. <br /><br />Hippocampus:
                <br />The hippocampus is actively involved in learning and
                memory. Research suggests it may also play an essential role in
                social anxiety.According to 2016 researchTrusted Source, when
                socially anxious people see faces of people they haven’t seen
                before, their hippocampus goes into overdrive. When they are
                repeatedly shown these faces, they never learn to become
                familiar as a person without anxiety does. Instead, they
                continue to identify the faces as threatening. This explains why
                people with social anxiety have a much harder time meeting new
                people.
